I've worked with a lot of languages and let me just say that having a big fat stack trace when something goes wrong is amazing. Java does this really well.

Not having a stack trace automatically like in Nodejs or Go is a really bad experience. I'm forced to log every time there is a potential error in case a problem happens in production.

You guys that have only ever written JavaScript don't know what you're missing!
